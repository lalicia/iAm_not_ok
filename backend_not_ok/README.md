This is the backend for iAm != "ok", my mental health app for bootcampers.

The backend is created with Express, dotenv, pg, and utilises an external database hosted by \_\_\_\_.

I was inspired to make this project to reaffirm my learning during project week by focussing on an idea my group didn't want to pursue, but that was close to my heart.

As I didn't work very much on backend during the project, I started with building that as I wanted to give myself some confidence, or at least stop myself worrying about. I fell at the first hurdle, unsure whether I needed Express, Express Generator, or Express Application Generator! These were all things referenced in my notes!

In the end, I confirmed with a fellow bootcamper that they used Express, and so I got started.
